Providing some example reference code to demonstrate proficiency in Java and object oriented programming.

In my examples, I tried to cover the following concepts:
- Concrete implementations of a couple of abstract data types (Queue, Stack) \[net.colingarvey.Queue, net.colingarvey.Stack\]
- Object-Oriented Programming (Inheritance, Composition, Encapsulation) \[net.colingarvey.School\]
- Interacting with a REST API and deserializing a JSON response into a Java object (net.colingarvey.GithubUser)
- Interacting and describing commonly used data structures in Java (List interface, ArrayList implementation, Arrays, Hashmaps)\[net.colingarvey.DataStructureExamples]
